### Steve Husak & Noah Mandelbaum

Capital One’s Contact Center application allows customer service agents to help our customers 24/7 across different channels of engagement including phone and chat. At the same time, up to 50 teams are developing new intent, making changes, and releasing in near real-time to accommodate shifting business, legal and regulatory needs. This talk will provide an overview of the history of challenges that were overcome to move from a pure monolith system to a platform that provides for fast, high-quality delivery with a minimum of friction among teams while establishing code consistency, open communication and open collaboration across our enterprise. We will go over the the high level architecture of the application as well as provide the lessons we have learned along the way in utilizing the Node.js/JavaScript ecosystem for our solution.
